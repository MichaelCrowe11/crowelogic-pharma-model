it's time to get it unloaded get the spawn worked with and get it ready to move out of the lab so we can go to the next process or project so before opening it up in the lab I'm just gonna depressurize it so I'll just take like a fresh alcohol soaked rag and I'm gonna open up the sterilizer from out here so we could just depressurize the chamber so when I go in the lab and open it up there's no trapped pressure in there and it makes it easier to pull the push the lid in push the door in that is so I just cover the top with an alcohol soaked rag and just open up the valve that escapes any built up pressure and then in doing so if there's any chance for anything to escape into the sterilizer which yeah we don't want happening it's covered with an alcohol soaked rag so I'm going to the lab and basically get prepped and get ready to start unloading so I'm in the lab I've gotten prepped everything's been wiped down the room has been freshly mopped and the autoclave has been depressurized now I'm gonna go ahead and open up the door so all right so that's all the spawn this is an old auto-acquaint 2 so it leaves a little bit of residue on the bags that I'll just wipe off so yeah these are sterilized spawn bags so this is how our grain spawn comes out and it's a composed of mylo or surrogum so this is a my preferred grain one of them for making spawn so yeah this is just sterile grain at this point it hasn't been turned into actual spawn all it needs is a fresh mushroom culture either from a peachy dish or liquid culture or you could even use a spores basically germinate in here and start my ceilium these are bags that are a little different than what we typically use here because this has the injection port so this is great for people that don't have a laboratory or a forbid because all you need is a syringe full of a culture or whatever you're growing and whatever edible species that you're growing and basically flim sterilize the syringe and just inject through the injection port that way you can grow out your own spawn and see the process from start to finish as much as possible so since these have gone through the autoclave and they get pretty pressurized in there I'm basically going to be just redistributing the grain in the moisture so I'm going to be doing that to all these bags in here just take the bag just kind of shake up the grain make sure it's nice and evenly distributed that way when you go to inoculate with your liquid culture so a much better quality grain in the long run you get an even colonization and it's a better quality spawn these bags have gone through the autoclave process for sterilization so they've been sterilized at a high rate of pressure higher than normal to basically kill off any kind of spores or microorganisms that could most likely survive 212 degree temperatures so this way we're able to super sterilize our spawn and that's super important for this part of the process being that spawn's going to you know be a big part of the cultivation process as far as inoculating multiple times its weights and substrate and producing mushrooms so yeah this has been autoclaved for about four to six hours is what I usually do depending on how how the autoclave has loaded so yeah this has been sterilized probably closer to six hours since we had 80 bags almost come out of here yeah the autoclave it's just a nice thing for me because it kind of just found its way to to me in a way there was somebody locally that I didn't really know about had started a mushroom business and I guess it just wasn't what they anticipated and they had bought a bunch of equipment like a bunch of equipment that they didn't need anymore and I remember just showing up to go get the mixer and she had an autoclave there too and she just was like if you just take everything you can have it for everything for a thousand so I ended up getting the autoclave mixer and the generator and then you know just trying to get everything over here was I guess the harder part because I had to find people with forklifts and stuff like that to load the autoclave onto the trailer drove it over here and then it kind of just sat here for almost a year until I was just ready to you know until I knew what to do with it so eventually I was ready to set up another lab which is the one I ran and then I was able to get the autoclave installed and everything hooked up so it's ended up working out pretty well there you have a bag of freshly sterile spawn and it's ready to inoculate we put the use and turn them to some mushrooms so with the grain spawn bags we use a different filter patch just because we want it to be a little bit more efficient and filtering out particulates and any kind of potential

I can Put any debris off to the side Just wheel my stainless steel table right in front of my grow room and I'll just lock the wheels So what's not moving around on me? Turn the humidity down while I'm harvesting right before harvest is recommended to To kind of cut the humidity down just a little bit that way your mushrooms I basically you get a longer shelf life out of them So yeah shiitake is a really interesting mushroom.  It's one of my favorite to grow It's also one of the most labor intensive Harvest where you have to cut each mushroom off one by one Oh All right So now we have some shiitake mushrooms right here that are ready to go I like to harvest them Right as the cap begins to open up, but it doesn't open up completely and So yeah, some of these blocks are really covered with shiitake mushrooms So yeah, we'll go ahead and harvest these right now So they are ready to go So yeah, these mushrooms are growing off of a mix of oak hardwood sawdust that I've supplemented with about 15 to 20 percent organic wheat brand So that organic wheat brand gives the mushrooms mycelium a nice nice nutritional boost to kind of take over the sawdust and increase your yield So you could just grow on just oak hardwood sawdust with no supplementation That actually would make it a little bit easier for the cultivator because you wouldn't need the sterilization process Which we utilize Due to the high nutrition in our substrate To kill off any kind of competitor organisms that can outcompete our mushroom mycelium.  So When you're just using like an oak hardwood sawdust with no supplementation you could just pasteurize it or just pour boiling 170 to 180 degree water over your sawdust to let it sit for about an hour at that temperature Then at that point you can let it cool and Anoculate with some grain spawn or sawdust spawn that's grown out with a shiitake culture You can buy spawn or if you don't know how to make spawn you can buy it somewhere and And just use that to inoculate your substrate and and start growing your own mushrooms and start getting a Bit of a glimpse of the process and start familiarizing yourself with the fruiting process And the colonization process understand the mycelium and how it develops and Learn from it.  So This This block has just been harvested so I'll just put it back And I just keep grabbing blocks and just keep cutting away and I'll weigh each box out to five pounds And when I'm harvesting these mushrooms I just cut right out the base As As close to the block but not trying to cut into the block So I like this drain because it does have small stems or short stems or both of these strains do And Yeah, I grow shiitake 3782 and 3790 which are just two Really cool shiitake strains 3782 is the one that you're seeing right here and it grows these nice Less dense of a cap than the 3790 so this cap is really good for just like crisping up Getting to like a nice light crisp Faster or just less less of a dense cap so 3790's real meaty real dense So yeah, this is what I mean by just takes longer to harvest I'm yielding all about two pounds per block and Takes me a few minutes to harvest that two pounds as compared to growing oyster mushrooms You can harvest two pounds and just one pull So There's some benefits to both uh If you have the space to grow shiitake and That's awesome It takes up more space and the amount of time it takes to grow one crop of shiitake you can produce four crops of oyster or Probably lion's mane too",

        "step": "So I get in our pink oysters ready to go in and this mushroom mycelium is pretty interesting if you let it go long enough you'll you'll get a lot of mushrooms that grow on the top of the bag it'll top fruit so it's good to get this one in the grow room right on time otherwise you can basically lose out on some of your yield all these oyster mushrooms you know we have the pink we have the gold we have the brown the blue there's the pearl all of them have their own unique characteristics flavor even aromas so everybody has their own preference some people do prefer the pinks some people like the blues you know it just depends on preference it could be their favorite color you know so that's a cool thing about oysters you get all these different variations within the same you know basically the same species you get these different strains they come from different parts of the globe so like the pink and gold oysters are native to Asia found like growing in tropical forests and climates they also have a very distinct flavor the pink is a it has a very strong for one it goes bad very quickly and within three days it develops a really unique odor some people compare it to like a seafood kind of like odor so with the pinks you definitely got to be careful that you're getting them to where they need to go they're getting used or sold in time and if not then you you got to dry them at least I would say at least by day three or four because if you get today three or four and they have like a smell and they get like a little wet and soggy then they become kind of unappealing to even dry at that point you just don't even want them so you got to really really work with this strain oyster mushrooms are referred to as oyster mushrooms because they have caps that kind of look like oyster shells so yeah that's what I called oyster mushrooms it's a unique name you know I'm not very fond of oysters anyways but I do like an oyster mushroom oyster mushrooms also grow out and really nice clusters usually get a nice cluster of anywhere from 20 to 50 mushrooms that grow out kind of like a bouquet and that's always an eye catcher and you know great for the markets or any clients that look at it they're definitely amazed by by them so yeah this is the pink oyster this one's a referred to scientifically as plurotus de jamour there's also another pink strain called plurotus some amelios austraminius so it's two different pink oysters the de jamour grows more of a deep reddish pink whereas the other the salmon oyster gets kind of like a lightish more of a lighter pink color but get a pretty good yield on it so as far as the shelf life goes they both are pretty short I'd say the pink oyster lasts five days after that it's it's done and then we have the golden oyster which is kind of like the pink it lasts longer but the mushrooms are super delicate and brittle it's called plurotus citrona pleides so that's a pretty good oyster mushroom we only grow it kind of during the warm remounts of the year as soon as it gets a little bit colder we just do like a blue white and brown oyster as far as the humidity for the different rooms goes basically everything's you know you kind of got to just judge it by the room depending on where your kind of where your crop is so if I just loaded up a room like this I'm going to turn up my humidity pretty high at the beginning as close to you know in the 90s as possible as the mushrooms start to grow out then the humidity is kind of gradually decreased up until harvest time because if you harvest and the mushrooms are too wet they're not going to last as long in the fridge so you're going to lose out on some shelf life so we have three grow rooms going on in our facility and depending on what stage the grow room is at it's kind of where you know the grow room manager will dictate what the humidity should be set at so constantly fluctuating humidity depending on what grow room you're in what kind of mushroom is growing in there and also what stage of the of the grow are you at are you just putting your mushrooms in humidity's turned up really high to kind of really it's to stimulate the mushrooms to grow to get a really nice pin set at the beginning kind of like a nature when you get this fresh rainfall and then within a couple days later you get nice fruiting the mushrooms in the wild so it's kind of like what we do in our grow room really really wet environment for the first couple days once we start seeing mushrooms come out gradually lower the humidity and kind of work our way down into the 80s up until harvest time having the humidity dialed in is super vital because yeah definitely affect your grow your pin set your overall yields and just your your time frame you know so if it's too dry you know you could walk in and you could see some you could see the mushrooms suffering from it they'll basically have you know dry spots on their caps and the mushrooms will start to shrivel up and basically not grow you're going to lose a ton of yields by not keeping your humidity up yeah if you're struggling with yields there's a couple things that you can look at there's uh for one I guess the first thing would be to look at your strain and see you know a lot of it depends on the strain as well how's the genetics and is this a strain that's likely just to produce a heavy yield um and if it's not the strain then you need to look at your substrate recipe and what are you feeding your mushrooms because they do like a balanced diet like us so you got to give them uh give them a good diet and if it's not the it's not your substrate formula then I don't know what to tell you there's a couple things it's your strain or your your recipe so it's basically it as far as the yield goes and it would be your grow environment too like your how's your you know your grow room needs to be dialed in to be able to maintain optimum conditions you know with humidity and not just humidity but with that air flow as well proper number of uh air exchanges and proper amount of air coming in for mushrooms to breathe because they are like us they breathe in oxygen and exhale CO2 due to our schedule of three production days a week and then when we do like 600 bags a week every week we usually have about a good five or six hundred bags to put in our grow rooms each grow room can hold like 500 blocks so um basically we just stay with our our production schedule we just create a schedule for producing and uh we produce that amount and we know that we're going to be harvesting x amount of mushrooms per week so it's just like a a system that's been developed for our production um so we kind of just know what our grow rooms can produce and we know what our our production schedule will look like for the week um so like let's say we're loading all these blocks in today uh in about a week within like a three to four day period if it's oyster mushrooms we'll harvest all these mushrooms at the same time or it's close together but like for the mind-talkie that's going to come at a different day so everything will same with the wines man that'll be a little bit of a different day but for the most part of the same week yes so with one of our accounts we did get a a pre-order for a restaurant week which is going to be um it's going to be in about ten days but we put these uh blocks of king trumpet in here just about three or four days ago just to get ready for that day we knew that um we had these pre-orders in we let them colonize for for three to four weeks so I like to let them ripen up and then I'll put them in the grow room and then within that time ten days and we get a harvest so once you get really accustomed to growing all these mushrooms and you can kind of figure out the timeframes on what it's going to take for spawn for colonization and then to fruit then you can really just dial in your timeframes for accounts like if you have chefs asking you for mushrooms or if you have people from the farmers markets wondering when you're going to have something in stock it's nice being able to tell them what day you'll be harvesting and uh basically to come through on your promise to actually harvest on that day and and deliver the goods and that really makes that makes your customers really happy if you can uh say hey I'm going to have these mushrooms in ten days and in ten days they're ready for them everything else is super easy you know grow mushrooms keep your stuff clean clean your facility get a schedule down for your team make sure everybody is on the same page and have a good time grow some mushrooms and feed your community",
        "context": "If everything goes accordingly we're doing about 600 of these bags a week and each of these bags are ping on the string we're going to be pulling about two to three pounds of mushrooms off of and you know on a good week at full full capacity that could be anywhere from 12 to 12 to 1,500 pounds of mushrooms for us utilizing all three grow rooms at once and it's quite a bit of mushrooms I mean it's it's a lot of mushrooms.  So it's crazy how fast that you know within a couple months from start to finish you can have you know thousands of pounds of mushrooms just from a single peachy dish and compared to like getting a pound of like chicken or ground beef I think a pound of mushrooms is a lot more as far as the visual you get a pretty good size amount of mushrooms so it's it breaks down and you can really really get the most out of them.  So I get in our pink oysters ready to go in and this mushroom mycelium is pretty interesting if you let it go long enough you'll you'll get a lot of mushrooms that grow on the top of the bag it'll top

So yeah, this is just a pretty easy harvest For the most part pretty pretty Pretty basic Just trim in the mushrooms off as clean as possible and if you wanted to you could actually second flush these blocks That would involve just letting these blocks completely dry out for about two weeks So if you grow them in a grow room you could just shut your humidity off for for about two weeks And then at that point you would rehydrate your blocks with a nice dunking some cold water Rehydrate them for about six to twelve hours some people do 24 hours I think that could be a bit long so Just be careful with that Then after that point you can just put them back in the grow room hose them down And within a few days mushrooms will begin to reappear and you can get another crop and Continue that process until your blocks become spent Here we just do the one flush we give most of our yield on our first flush Then at that point we uh Just recycle the blocks into compost or whatnot So you have a shiitake mushroom my sealium is really interesting you can notice how the block Is completely brown basically Shitake mushroom is the only one that really really does this and uh starts out white Then after about two weeks it begins pop corning so you get this nice uh bumpy Bumpy surface then after that it starts to brown and ripen So we let them go for about eight to twelve weeks Depending on the strain Before we even put them in the grow room That ensures you get a really nice crop of shitake if you put them in there when they're still white You're not going to get as much of a yield The shitake is not going to be as top quality So as with any mushroom Uh Recommended uh preparation is to cook your mushrooms mushrooms should never be eaten raw And uh if you do eat them raw you're not getting any nutritional content from them so I like to prepare these just like sauteing them a simple saute for 15 to 20 minutes over medium heat Uh In addition with some garlic and a little bit of oil and you can ask also top it off with a little white wine and tomorrow Uh makes a great addition to like a stir fry or rice dish In addition to a ramen or anything like that it's really good Shitake is Very very tasty mushroom and it's also very medicinal.  It's a good at boosting the immune function And it's been used as a food and medicine for quite a while It's also commonly used in like miso soups Stuff like that You can find it in a lot of like pan-Asian cuisine That's a classic gourmet mushroom",

They're actively producing spores as we speak Yeah, and that's what I do I just dropped some on a on a piece of aluminum foil drop the cap on a piece of aluminum foil covered it with a Court-sized jar The next day I came in and there was a nice little white Spore print depending on each species of mushroom you get a different color of spore print depending on the species or strain So like our pink oyster mushroom produces a pink spore print Chitankis produce a white one the chestnut mushroom produces like a chestnut brown spore P",

        "step": "Shataki has a long shelf life and lines main that one goes for about two weeks we've found so yeah generally with the most of our mushrooms we're getting about two weeks out of the mushrooms before they are no longer marketable so we're just specializing in wood loving species so species that basically decompose hardwood in nature they'll find them growing off like fresh trees or they recently fall in trees no strains are like Shataki oyster mushrooms more of the medicinal species such as racie, turkey tail, lion's mane you find my Taki growing on oak or in certain hardwoods we do king trumpets we do two varieties of like king oyster we do all of the oyster mushrooms throughout the year pink gold pearl blue white so those are all grown on our hardwood substrate Shataki mushrooms of course and kriminis and button mushrooms and portabellas those are secondary decomposing mushrooms so those mushrooms desire like manure or compost based substrates that basically we don't really like to you wouldn't want to keep that stuff under the same roof we wouldn't want to be growing specialty mushrooms in the same room that we're composting a bunch of manure just because you don't want any kind of cross contamination getting into your grows we're able to get a really good entry into the mushroom industry with specialty mushrooms a lot of people can start off with just oyster mushrooms and you can grow those on really any agriculture waste from straws to certain kinds of beddings to basically even newspaper and paper towels I mean oyster mushrooms are really aggressive coffee waste can be used just like a simple pasteurization of those substrates is always is really all that's needed for it to be effective so it doesn't need to be expensive or costly system to sterilize but yeah maybe one day we will do portabellas or buttons but definitely really enjoy doing the gourmet specialty mushrooms all the colors different shapes sizes that you can get and also the medicinal benefits that they offer are far greater than what you'd find in like a portabella or community mushroom or button mushroom these are the mushrooms that contain those anti-cancer anti-tumor benefits those amino modulating immune system enhancing benefits so these are the mushrooms that I like to eat and I hope you do too this is called Ganna Derma Cecil this is a racie species from Palmer Woods near Michigan it's a beautiful species of racia produces these nice antlers and conks that are really desirable and this mushrooms mainly used for the medicinal benefits we can take it and brew it into a tea or make tinctures out of it and utilize it for the health properties or health enhancing benefits that this mushroom offers it's been used by Eastern medicine for about 4,000 years so it's definitely good for a lot of things and it's known as the mushroom of immortality so we'll just cut these mushrooms off they're really woody compared to most mushrooms most mushrooms are 90% water and 10% tissue this mushroom here is about 70% water and 30% tissue so it makes a real woody woody mushroom that needs to be can't be resalted or cooked it really needs to be boiled down into a tea to get all those goodies out of it so I'm just trimming here the base right now just getting all these we had a lot of demand for racie I wasn't growing that much of it at first and then I kind of was just doing it for personal and then I kind of brought some out to the farmer's market and just kind of started sharing with it with people and from there I got a huge demand everybody asking for it and recently with a lot of things that are going on everybody really wants to root racie mushrooms just because of the immune modulating benefits and the health enhancing properties that this mushroom offers so yeah depending on demand or if a mushroom's not selling too good if we don't see it doing too good we'll just trim back on demand and just grow what we need I'm starting to see more specialty mushrooms available as they're gaining popularity a lot of people are catching on to a lot of the knowledge that comes with the specialty mushrooms and health benefits so we're supplying a couple grocery stores out here in Phoenix AJ's fine foods is one of them and two other grocery stores in the East Valley called the Super Sition Ranch Farm Market and people love them people are excited to be able to try something new and not your typical average run of the you know run of the mill but in our Portobello mushroom something that has more flavor and you can kind of get creative with some of these mushrooms and really do something unique this racie was inaugulated in on December 14th so it's four months old it took about four months to get here from the day of inoculation to now it takes quite a while this one does take longer than any of the mushrooms that we grow and there we go we have a beautiful set of racie mushrooms that is just amazing yeah racie typically it goes for for about four months a hundred and day hundred and twenty or so this one we harvest shatake about two months eight weeks oyster I can do those in three weeks sometimes less if it's the pink oyster usually you'll see fruits in as little as ten days from the day of inoculation so you can kind of play with what strain works best for your time and your schedule the price is kind of developed by us due to the cost of production like the labor involved for harvesting does it take longer is it easy is there much cleaning needed for each mushroom and you know really how long does it take to grow for us how long do we have to wait before we can harvest and get the mushroom the product so yeah oysters are going to kind of be the most affordable from us just because we can grow them so quick and racie is going to be the most expensive because it takes so long also another thing that comes into play is the demand and the demand high or low for this mushroom so like lion's mane has quite a bit of demand medicinally and and culinary so we have a little bit of a higher price point on that one and typically you'll see mushrooms averaging anywhere from eight bucks a pound to eighteen bucks a pound depending on if it's wholesale or retail and then racie I mean it could be up to fifteen dollars an ounce dry or or even lower than that depending on who grew it if it came from China you can get Chinese grown racie for like forty bucks a pound thirty bucks a pound dry all right well here's our lion's mane this mushroom also called Hiroshima and Asius is a wonderful teeth fungi so instead of having a traditional cap and gills this mushroom has these little spines that elongate and give it a really unique look appearance texture and also just qualities the mushroom is a medicinal mushroom as well as the culinary delight known for the fact that it can enhance cognitive function boost your memory help regenerate old dead brain cells so it promotes nerve growth factor it helps synthesize new basically NGF through herisonones and hearing asians so we'll just harvest the mushroom kind of just pull it right up I do something a little different so for the first flush I like to top-fruit this mushroom I'll grow it right out the front and it just produces this lovely mass of lion's mane mushrooms once that's harvested the baggie will get rolled up and fold it over and then I'll just put a couple of slices on the bag to help for a second flush to pop out and that second flush will basically be just this nice cluster of lions mane so I'm getting the most out of this mushroom and the nature you this would be a hardwood loving species that you would just find growing right off the side of a hardwood tree and yeah a lot of people will use it for the for like a crab or lobster replacement they say that the teeth give it to texture similar to crab or lobster I personally don't eat seafood but I do love this mushroom and it has a wonderful flavor I can add it into like do a mushroom taco with it or add it into a stir fry with another mushroom and just get this wonderful texture from it once the CO2 levels are are real low and the moisture levels are really high the mushrooms are signal to to produce high CO2 is something that the mushrooms encountered during colonization phases and then high O2 levels are when the mushroom mycelium is really starting to break through that surface of the tree and be exposed to to conditions basically optimum for mushroom fruit body production and then for the cleaning of the lions man we just have this little little bit of sawdust right on the back and you can just kind of tear that right off or trim it with scissors and then yeah we have just a clean nice lion's mane that's ready for the market or medicine",
        "context": "So yeah we give our blocks a really nice smack on all sides and from there we throw them in our grow room and that gives us this really nice pin set where we just get mushrooms all over the block and we're really happy with that so yeah and then when it comes time to harvest we just basically cut each mushroom right off into our tray and then from there we can go ahead and pack everything in the next warehouse and get everything to the desired weights in our cases and get it into the cold storage.  Shataki's have quite a good shelf life once harvested the mushrooms generally last two to three weeks oyster mushrooms have the shortest shelf life usually we're seeing those in about seven days they're really no longer marketable we can take those home and eat them ourselves or possibly dry them and turn it into another product.  Shataki has a long shelf life and lines main that one goes for about two weeks we've found so yeah generally with the most of our mushrooms we're getting about two weeks out of the mushrooms before

history back when mushroom cultivation was kind of in its infancy that the way of growing the mushrooms would be to find mushrooms growing in a patch and then you dig around in that area find a nice growth of mycelium and basically take a piece of that back I guess soil and mycelium planted in another area and then come back in the next season and then you would have mushrooms growing in that area but it's actually a little bit more no you can't take a mushroom and just plant it and expect to have more mushrooms growing it's definitely a process that requires collecting the mushrooms for so let's see like this mushroom each mushroom has most of them due to ping on if it's a polypore or a gild mushroom or a tooth mushroom you have all these different ways that the mushrooms can distribute their spores so for most mushrooms they have like a section under the cap or area under the cap known as the gills where the spores are actually produced and then they're released back into nature away for us to be able to grow mushrooms is to basically cut the cap off and place it on a piece of foil or construction paper and allow it to sit there for 12 to 24 hours covered and the mushroom will basically eject tons of spores onto this surface that we allow it to once the spores are are basically collected you can take them into a sterile environment or a lab inside of a still air box and you can have a sterile water I usually will cook up a jar of sterile water and a pressure sterilizer have that in my glove box with the sterile empty syringe and a sterile scalpel I'll take the piece of foil and I'll take it over the sterile water using the scalpel scraping the spores into the water and at that point I can suck the spore filled solution or water up into a syringe that syringe will basically be left to hydrate for you know if the spore print is dry let let that spore syringe hydrate for about 12 to 24 hours and then at that point you can use it to inoculate peachy plates so once a not once spores are placed onto the peachy plates they can be allowed to germinate and form out the mycelium and then from there you can take sectors of mycelium being that everything is clean and no molds show up and if molds do show up and that would take some cleanup work so you just keep transferring until the plate grows out really clean and from there that's used to make your grain spawn from there you can use that to inoculate whatever substrate that species desires get full colonization and then give it the proper fruiting requirements as needed per species and you can have for your mushrooms that's how you grow them or you could just grow out the spawn and go in and calculate areas outdoors or logs there's multiple routes you could take to get to grow on these mushrooms so simply know you can't plant a mushroom and expect new ones to grow I was just going over some of these oyster mushrooms and this is the Elmoistre mushroom it's also one of the most prominent spore producing oyster mushrooms that I've seen these aren't even actually too over mature yet but we can see these icicle-like elongations of spores so these are actually the spores of the mushroom so if you were to collect these spores you could use these to grow more mushrooms so basically this is where kind of it all starts as far as the mushroom life cycle yeah you get the spore and these are germinated turn to mycelium grown out just to produce more fruit bodies just to produce more spores just to grow more mushrooms so it's pretty cool stuff but yeah we could see these super long ice-cold like dangling spore formations and these are why you want to wear a mask in your grow room if you're working in there all day especially with a lot of oyster mushrooms you can get these clogged up into your lungs and all up in your sinuses and they'll give you a super bad stuff he knows and almost food-like symptoms if you're especially sensitive to this kind of stuff I remember when I first started growing a lot of oyster mushrooms and I grew them at home I had like a fridge that I stored them in and we stored all like over a hundred pounds in there and then like over the next couple days I noticed like a thin layer of dust covering everything in the house and I realized that those were spores coming from the fridge because we everybody in the house got stuff he knows is running noses and almost like flu-like symptoms once we were able to get the mushrooms enclosed in these containers that basically limited the spores from escaping then the symptoms don't away but definitely will always remember that and I don't know since then I've gotten more used to being around these mushroom spores another cool thing is I mean I'll probably can't see it now but you can actually see the mushroom spores kind of like smoking you could see like these little plumes of this dust smoke like stuff arising from the mushrooms and that is spores they're just shooting out spores and throughout the life cycle of this mushroom it'll distribute over a billion spores these things are super aggressive and mushrooms are really good at continuing their their life cycle",

The other thing you can do is stack your blocks like that so we like to do that and we can kind of get these walls of mushrooms and that's if we have a lot of blocks and stock and we really need a maximize our space that's why I like growing on hardwood sawdust because you can just make blocks and you can build with them and stack them and make walls walls of mushrooms so much better for me and for people that are growing in small spaces and you don't have access to tons of space to grow sawdust works great all those oysters are done and like I said the oysters are really easy to load compared to shataki where it takes more work I also have this pink oyster we'll go ahead and put that in Gerberum one today that's it that's it everything for today as far as loading into the Gerberum we'll periodically step into the incubation center every day and take a look to see what's going to be going in next and try to plan accordingly so you'll also notice that each mushroom mycelium gives off a smell that's really really fragrant and each species has their own unique characteristic type smell so we'll find like the oyster mushrooms are kind of like a somewhat reminiscent of like an inesite or like a like a vanilla extract and like shataki smells like crushed fresh shataki mushrooms lion's mane has like a nice pleasant smell and it smells like fresh lion's mane mushrooms so you'll build the smell your spawn or your fruiting blocks and you can kind of tell how help they are as you can see they are they're just really ready to go into the Gerberum we notice there's some nice little clusters of baby oyster mushrooms popping up all over the place these literally just popped up within the last day so we're gonna get them in there and within a week these will be ready for harvest and it's for eating all right start placing them in here we're just doing some stacking in here to make room for a few extra blocks that way I can get everything on one rack which is gonna make a simple cut on each bag so we'll start from the top row and just come straight through and I'll also make a line right here and right there and that for me has given the given the best opportunity for the mushrooms to grow and develop without them getting caught under anything plastic so I get really good yields by making my cuts like this it also doesn't make it to where your block is too exposed like if you were to cut an X it can kind of open up a little bit more than this very easy initiation process with the oyster mushroom so it's crazy how these oyster mushrooms or any of the mushrooms can can produce so much uh so much food in such a little space here just from this one rack alone we have so we have we have almost 40 blocks we'll get about three pounds of block this will be 120 pounds just coming from one rack so not much space required to grow lots of lots of mushrooms it's one of the things very unique about them you just take these small spaces and maximize them and that's it I'll just double check to make sure I don't miss anything and looks good so at this point I will seal up my grow room so I can let this humidity stay in there and let these mushrooms start to get what they need as far as environmental conditions and stuff like that and we'll also take a step into the pink list of room or grow room one try to get this pink oyster block in there so we can get these mushrooms off of it so just cut a little hole at the top and uh first of all the air out what you could do too let's just take it open up your bag and you can see all these pink oysters that we have growing in there we can just go ahead and take those out and remove them the way it's easy to put our block on the rack and it's not fun even this could be cooked up and used as food or it's usually really tough and not really desirable but you could also dry it and powder it use that for like a soup or something like that now we'll just go ahead and fold up the block as usual and uh I just go ahead and put it right on top of one of these blocks just like that I'm just going and slice that up let that grow and as you see this grow room is uh looking pretty good we have some pink oysters in here growing out and uh different just a couple different varieties of trumpet like the black pearl king trumpet growing on alder sawdust and it's about it I'm going to get some stuff harvested in here and so these will be ready in about 24 hours these have been going in here for about four days I put these in here actually they've been going for about five days now I loaded these up on Saturday so now we're on we're on Thursday and they are quite well developed some of them more than others so we'll look look back here let's say this one for instance and we can see the mushrooms are developed pretty well well at these grow at another day because they're definitely going to increase in size the pink oyster compared to like the blue and white oysters is you don't get as much biological efficiency meaning the yield isn't quite as much so usually we average about two pounds on these but they're just beautiful mushrooms for their color and they do taste pretty good and really it's the color that dazzles people but it's just like in another oyster mushroom as far as flavor goes and you can utilize them in recipes that call for mushrooms but they grow very easily so that's what a plus and they love the warm temperatures so if you live in a warmer part of the world then pink oysters are our mushroom for you they have some third flush pappinos back here so these have been these were actually in our last or one of our growing videos but we flushed them a couple times already some of these are a little bit well those were overdone so yeah these were actually ready yesterday but I didn't get to them in time so they're a little bit over mature and that means that they're basically just a little over ripe so the caps are starting to curl up and they're a little bit wavy and we also noticed that there's a nice sport deposits so they're starting to produce a lot of spores so this is a good stage to go ahead and take a spore print if anything I mean we can see all the spores that are coming out and really you just really want to grow these mushrooms like this if you're just going to eat them for personal use or if you just know some way that really like some like this but they don't last as long in the fridge so this is kind of what I like to this is why I like to harvest them when the caps are still kind of rolled in like this so that's peak peak harvest time or right as the veal has just started to break so you can see this right here this is called the veal of the mushroom and that's usually attached all the way up until maturity so that's another way to determine the age of the mushroom we could see these pappino mushrooms where the veal has just started to break off and we can go ahead and harvest these now and they'll maintain a really nice flavor for quite a long time and the store a lot longer in the fridge compared to you know some of our over harvested pappinis but these still taste excellent so we'll just take these home and cook them in our own dinner tonight they go great in like pasta sauces and soups and really whatever it's a great mushroom it has like a nice blue oyster this was like a third flush for us so we're still getting good yields I mean I would say this is almost half a pound so for a third flush that's pretty good fine ok",

really need a maximize our space that's why I like growing on hardwood sawdust because you can just make blocks and you can build with them and stack them and make walls walls of mushrooms so much better for me and for people that are growing in small spaces and you don't have access to tons of space to grow sawdust works great all those oysters are done and like I said the oysters are really easy to load compared to shataki where it takes more work I also have this pink oyster we'll go ahead and put that in Gerberum one today that's it that's it everything for today as far as loading into the Gerberum we'll periodically step into the incubation center every day and take a look to see what's going to be going in next and try to plan accordingly so you'll also notice that each mushroom mycelium gives off a smell that's really really fragrant and each species has their own unique characteristic type smell so we'll find like the oyster mushrooms are kind of like a somewhat reminiscent of like an inesite or like a like a vanilla extract and like shataki smells like crushed fresh shataki mushrooms lion's mane has like a nice pleasant smell and it smells like fresh lion's mane mushrooms so you'll build the smell your spawn or your fruiting blocks and you can kind of tell how help they are as you can see they are they're just really ready to go into the Gerberum we notice there's some nice little clusters of baby oyster mushrooms popping up all over the place these literally just popped up within the last day so we're gonna get them in there and within a week these will be ready for harvest and it's for eating all right start placing them in here we're just doing some stacking in here to make room for a few extra blocks that way I can get everything on one rack which is gonna make a simple cut on each bag so we'll start from the top row and just come straight through and I'll also make a line right here and right there and that for me has given the given the

        "context": "I always fold my bag with the filter patch facing in there's been times where I when I first started and I accidentally folded a bag like that I found that the mycelium was actually able to creep up and grow throughout this filter patch and I found mushrooms growing throughout the filter patch as well.  Same with lions man a lot of these strains if you're do if you are like side fruiting make sure you're folding this filter patch inwards that way the mycelium the oxygen and stuff like that is blocked off if the mycelium grows up here it's not going to produce any fruit bodies so that won't deduct from any of your yields and your mycelium won't be utilizing any or exhaust any unnecessary energy producing those fruit bodies that really are no good and have no market value.

Gotta make sure you get the back back end you know always you don't want to forget any mushrooms back here.  If everything goes accordingly we're doing about 600 of these bags a week and each of these bags are ping on the string we're going to be pulling about two to three pounds of mushrooms off of and you know on a good week at full full capacity that could be anywhere from 12 to 12 to 1,500 pounds of mushrooms for us utilizing all three grow rooms at once and it's quite a bit of mushrooms I mean it's it's a lot of mushrooms",

        "step": "So I get in our pink oysters ready to go in and this mushroom mycelium is pretty interesting if you let it go long enough you'll you'll get a lot of mushrooms that grow on the top of the bag it'll top fruit so it's good to get this one in the grow room right on time otherwise you can basically lose out on some of your yield all these oyster mushrooms you know we have the pink we have the gold we have the brown the blue there's the pearl all of them have their own unique characteristics flavor even aromas so everybody has their own preference some people do prefer the pinks some people like the blues you know it just depends on preference it could be their favorite color you know so that's a cool thing about oysters you get all these different variations within the same you know basically the same species you get these different strains they come from different parts of the globe so like the pink and gold oysters are native to Asia found like growing in tropical forests and climates they also have a very distinct flavor the pink is a it has a very strong for one it goes bad very quickly and within three days it develops a really unique odor some people compare it to like a seafood kind of like odor so with the pinks you definitely got to be careful that you're getting them to where they need to go they're getting used or sold in time and if not then you you got to dry them at least I would say at least by day three or four because if you get today three or four and they have like a smell and they get like a little wet and soggy then they become kind of unappealing to even dry at that point you just don't even want them so you got to really really work with this strain oyster mushrooms are referred to as oyster mushrooms because they have caps that kind of look like oyster shells so yeah that's what I called oyster mushrooms it's a unique name you know I'm not very fond of oysters anyways but I do like an oyster mushroom oyster mushrooms also grow out and really nice clusters usually get a nice cluster of anywhere from 20 to 50 mushrooms that grow out kind of like a bouquet and that's always an eye catcher and you know great for the markets or any clients that look at it they're definitely amazed by by them so yeah this is the pink oyster this one's a referred to scientifically as plurotus de jamour there's also another pink strain called plurotus some amelios austraminius so it's two different pink oysters the de jamour grows more of a deep reddish pink whereas the other the salmon oyster gets kind of like a lightish more of a lighter pink color but get a pretty good yield on it so as far as the shelf life goes they both are pretty short I'd say the pink oyster lasts five days after that it's it's done and then we have the golden oyster which is kind of like the pink it lasts longer but the mushrooms are super delicate and brittle it's called plurotus citrona pleides so that's a pretty good oyster mushroom we only grow it kind of during the warm remounts of the year as soon as it gets a little bit colder we just do like a blue white and brown oyster as far as the humidity for the different rooms goes basically everything's you know you kind of got to just judge it by the room depending on where your kind of where your crop is so if I just loaded up a room like this I'm going to turn up my humidity pretty high at the beginning as close to you know in the 90s as possible as the mushrooms start to grow out then the humidity is kind of gradually decreased up until harvest time because if you harvest and the mushrooms are too wet they're not going to last as long in the fridge so you're going to lose out on some shelf life so we have three grow rooms going on in our facility and depending on what stage the grow room is at it's kind of where you know the grow room manager will dictate what the humidity should be set at so constantly fluctuating humidity depending on what grow room you're in what kind of mushroom is growing in there and also what stage of the of the grow are you at are you just putting your mushrooms in humidity's turned up really high to kind of really it's to stimulate the mushrooms to grow to get a really nice pin set at the beginning kind of like a nature when you get this fresh rainfall and then within a couple days later you get nice fruiting the mushrooms in the wild so it's kind of like what we do in our grow room really really wet environment for the first couple days once we start seeing mushrooms come out gradually lower the humidity and kind of work our way down into the 80s up until harvest time having the humidity dialed in is super vital because yeah definitely affect your grow your pin set your overall yields and just your your time frame you know so if it's too dry you know you could walk in and you could see some you could see the mushrooms suffering from it they'll basically have you know dry spots on their caps and the mushrooms will start to shrivel up and basically not grow you're going to lose a ton of yields by not keeping your humidity up yeah if you're struggling with yields there's a couple things that you can look at there's uh for one I guess the first thing would be to look at your strain and see you know a lot of it depends on the strain as well how's the genetics and is this a strain that's likely just to produce a heavy yield um and if it's not the strain then you need to look at your substrate recipe and what are you feeding your mushrooms because they do like a balanced diet like us so you got to give them uh give them a good diet and if it's not the it's not your substrate formula then I don't know what to tell you there's a couple things it's your strain or your your recipe so it's basically it as far as the yield goes and it would be your grow environment too like your how's your you know your grow room needs to be dialed in to be able to maintain optimum conditions you know with humidity and not just humidity but with that air flow as well proper number of uh air exchanges and proper amount of air coming in for mushrooms to breathe because they are like us they breathe in oxygen and exhale CO2 due to our schedule of three production days a week and then when we do like 600 bags a week every week we usually have about a good five or six hundred bags to put in our grow rooms each grow room can hold like 500 blocks so um basically we just stay with our our production schedule we just create a schedule for producing and uh we produce that amount and we know that we're going to be harvesting x amount of mushrooms per week so it's just like a a system that's been developed for our production um so we kind of just know what our grow rooms can produce and we know what our our production schedule will look like for the week um so like let's say we're loading all these blocks in today uh in about a week within like a three to four day period if it's oyster mushrooms we'll harvest all these mushrooms at the same time or it's close together but like for the mind-talkie that's going to come at a different day so everything will same with the wines man that'll be a little bit of a different day but for the most part of the same week yes so with one of our accounts we did get a a pre-order for a restaurant week which is going to be um it's going to be in about ten days but we put these uh blocks of king trumpet in here just about three or four days ago just to get ready for that day we knew that um we had these pre-orders in we let them colonize for for three to four weeks so I like to let them ripen up and then I'll put them in the grow room and then within that time ten days and we get a harvest so once you get really accustomed to growing all these mushrooms and you can kind of figure out the timeframes on what it's going to take for spawn for colonization and then to fruit then you can really just dial in your timeframes for accounts like if you have chefs asking you for mushrooms or if you have people from the farmers markets wondering when you're going to have something in stock it's nice being able to tell them what day you'll be harvesting and uh basically to come through on your promise to actually harvest on that day and and deliver the goods and that really makes that makes your customers really happy if you can uh say hey I'm going to have these mushrooms in ten days and in ten days they're ready for them everything else is super easy you know grow mushrooms keep your stuff clean clean your facility get a schedule down for your team make sure everybody is on the same page and have a good time grow some mushrooms and feed your community",

So it's crazy how fast that you know within a couple months from start to finish you can have you know thousands of pounds of mushrooms just from a single peachy dish and compared to like getting a pound of like chicken or ground beef I think a pound of mushrooms is a lot more as far as the visual you get a pretty good size amount of mushrooms so it's it breaks down and you can really really get the most out of them.  So I get in our pink oysters ready to go in and this mushroom mycelium is pretty interesting if you let it go long enough you'll you'll get a lot of mushrooms that grow on the top of the bag it'll top

E.  zero so this is the strain that produces more of the teeth and it's actually fruited right off the side for the first flush so we can just have a nice diversity of the way the fruit bodies develop so we can just kind of have a lot of different options for any way that wants the mushroom right here we just loaded up some chestnut mushrooms some of them have like started top fruiting before we could get them in the girl room so at that point I just cut the top of the bag off and put it in the girl room the mushrooms will get pretty big chestnuts and when you don't see that many mushrooms I find that usually the mushrooms get really meaty and a lot of the mushrooms or a lot of the blocks are just side fruited or top fruited so we just load the blocks in just like we do any of these ones and just make a nice diagonal cut on the front of the block so we can get a nice crop then we just have some lions man really old this is like a fourth flush some of them we've just been letting hang around especially this time of year where it's a little bit slower for us in the day of the summer so we have a lot more space to grow more mushrooms so just let them do their thing but this actually started out as one of the you know 10 to 12 pound blocks so you can see how much mass the mushroom has utilized is basically just broken down the substrate and exalted it into these fresh mushroom fruit bodies so that's pretty amazing and the block weighs next to nothing I would say it's like a it's about a five pound block right now so it's seven pounds of seven pounds gone into mushrooms so it's pretty cool and that's actually basically it for this girl I mean sides that and it's fully stocked and we'll be harvesting out of this girl for quite a while should get quite a yield",

        "context": "I can Put any debris off to the side Just wheel my stainless steel table right in front of my grow room and I'll just lock the wheels So what's not moving around on me? Turn the humidity down while I'm harvesting right before harvest is recommended to To kind of cut the humidity down just a little bit that way your mushrooms I basically you get a longer shelf life out of them So yeah shiitake is a really interesting mushroom.  It's one of my favorite to grow It's also one of the most labor intensive Harvest where you have to cut each mushroom off one by one Oh All right So now we have some shiitake mushrooms right here that are ready to go I like to harvest them Right as the cap begins to open up, but it doesn't open up completely and So yeah, some of these blocks are really covered with shiitake mushrooms So yeah, we'll go ahead and harvest these right now So they are ready to go So yeah, these mushrooms are growing off of a mix of oak hardwood sawdust that I've supplemented with about 15 to 20 percent organic wheat brand So that organic wheat brand gives the mushrooms mycelium a nice nice nutritional boost to kind of take over the sawdust and increase your yield So you could just grow on just oak hardwood sawdust with no supplementation That actually would make it a little bit easier for the cultivator because you wouldn't need the sterilization process Which we utilize Due to the high nutrition in our substrate To kill off any kind of competitor organisms that can outcompete our mushroom mycelium.  So When you're just using like an oak hardwood sawdust with no supplementation you could just pasteurize it or just pour boiling 170 to 180 degree water over your sawdust to let it sit for about an hour at that temperature Then at that point you can let it cool and Anoculate with some grain spawn or sawdust spawn that's grown out with a shiitake culture You can buy spawn or if you don't know how to make spawn you can buy it somewhere and And just use that to inoculate your substrate and and start growing your own mushrooms and start getting a Bit of a glimpse of the process and start familiarizing yourself with the fruiting process And the colonization process understand the mycelium and how it develops and Learn from it.  So This This block has just been harvested so I'll just put it back And I just keep grabbing blocks and just keep cutting away and I'll weigh each box out to five pounds And when I'm harvesting these mushrooms I just cut right out the base As As close to the block but not trying to cut into the block So I like this drain because it does have small stems or short stems or both of these strains do And Yeah, I grow shiitake 3782 and 3790 which are just two Really cool shiitake strains 3782 is the one that you're seeing right here and it grows these nice Less dense of a cap than the 3790 so this cap is really good for just like crisping up Getting to like a nice light crisp Faster or just less less of a dense cap so 3790's real meaty real dense So yeah, this is what I mean by just takes longer to harvest I'm yielding all about two pounds per block and Takes me a few minutes to harvest that two pounds as compared to growing oyster mushrooms You can harvest two pounds and just one pull So There's some benefits to both uh If you have the space to grow shiitake and That's awesome It takes up more space and the amount of time it takes to grow one crop of shiitake you can produce four crops of oyster or Probably lion's mane too.  So yeah, this is just a pretty easy harvest For the most part pretty pretty Pretty basic Just trim in the mushrooms off as clean as possible and if you wanted to you could actually second flush these blocks That would involve just letting these blocks completely dry out for about two weeks So if you grow them in a grow room you could just shut your humidity off for for about two weeks And then at that point you would rehydrate your blocks with a nice dunking some cold water Rehydrate them for about six to twelve hours some people do 24 hours I think that could be a bit long so Just be careful with that Then after that point you can just put them back in the grow room hose them down And within a few days mushrooms will begin to reappear and you can get another crop and Continue that process until your blocks become spent Here we just do the one flush we give most of our yield on our first flush Then at that point we uh Just recycle the blocks into compost or whatnot So you have a shiitake mushroom my sealium is really interesting you can notice how the block Is completely brown basically Shitake mushroom is the only one that really really does this and uh starts out white Then after about two weeks it begins pop corning so you get this nice uh bumpy Bumpy surface then after that it starts to brown and ripen So we let them go for about eight to twelve weeks Depending on the strain Before we even put them in the grow room That ensures you get a really nice crop of shitake if you put them in there when they're still white You're not going to get as much of a yield The shitake is not going to be as top quality So as with any mushroom Uh Recommended uh preparation is to cook your mushrooms mushrooms should never be eaten raw And uh if you do eat them raw you're not getting any nutritional content from them so I like to prepare these just like sauteing them a simple saute for 15 to 20 minutes over medium heat Uh In addition with some garlic and a little bit of oil and you can ask also top it off with a little white wine and tomorrow Uh makes a great addition to like a stir fry or rice dish In addition to a ramen or anything like that it's really good Shitake is Very very tasty mushroom and it's also very medicinal",

the table and we could start with the pink oyster or also this species is known as Plorotus Deja Moore and it produces these wonderful clusters of these pink mushrooms that have these wonderful showy bright pink gills and the mushroom is oyster species so it's one of the many oyster species that we can grow and it has a wonderful flavor it's a little tougher than some of the oyster mushrooms but a lot of people like it for that pink color it gives and yeah it's really nice we also have a golden oyster right here this is a Plorotus citrona pleides and it produces these wonderful clusters of many mushrooms that have yellow to goldish color this mushroom has a wonderful flavor some kind of compare it to cashews the pink and golden oyster are oyster mushrooms that originate in Asia and these actual cultures came from a Japanese commercial culture the stem on the golden oyster mushroom is also edible and pretty tasty it goes great in like stir fries rice dishes soups it really goes good in like Asian style cuisine also we have our lion's mane mushroom right here and this is the wonderful teeth fungus it produces these little tight pom-poms with all these little teeth or ice cool like elongations instead of having gills like you would see in most mushrooms where the spores are produced underneath the cap this mushroom actually produce spores through each of the teeth and the teeth also give it a wonderful texture some will kind of compare it to that of crab or lobster when sauteed in like a garlic butter but I've even found it's kind of take on like a chicken like texture when cooked right or sauteed simply with a little bit of white wine and maybe a tablespoon of tamari added in it brings out a wonderful flavor and it lends well to like stir fries rice dishes or even used as a as I honestly like a meat substitute in like a mushroom taco and yeah simply just saute it up and add it into your favorite recipe next we have the folio de nemaco mushroom so this is a folio de species and it's actually relative to the chestnut mushroom that we grow the folio de produces a kind of like a gelatinous like substance underneath the caps and underneath the gills and that'll actually prevent it from drying out in nature it's highly cultivated in like Japan and Asian countries so you can add it into like a miso soup or fried rice dish stir fries or even just sauteed and simply garnished over your favorite meats and veggies here we have a really nice robust blue oyster mushroom that we grow and this is still in the younger stages this would actually be a really good time to harvest these things just for the presentation point of them they still have that really nice blue color and towards the bottom we can even see a light greenish color coming out so this is like the blue green oyster mushroom and it's very dense very meaty it has a really good shelf life compared to some of the other oyster mushrooms I'll find this one last thing about 10 days in the fridge compared to like five to set five to six days with the pinks or golds so this mushroom is very versatile it can really go into anything that calls for mushrooms it has a very savory flavor almost poultry like and it's very easy to grow in my opinion and I love that it just produces all these wonderful blue robust mushrooms and next we just have some racially mushrooms this is again a derma saseel and this mushroom is a medicinal mushroom of course so you would basically harvest these antlers or conks and brew them into a tea or make a tincture out of them and really just use the mushroom for it's immune immunomodulating benefits it's able to basically enhance your overall immune function it's been shown to help with the treatment of cancers and tumors and also aid in my chemotherapy treatment because a lot of people will suffer from fatigue and stuff like that so this will help with fatigue it's been used throughout Eastern medicine for over 4,000 years so there's a lot of research on the mushroom and documentation of the mushroom being used throughout many centuries and here we have the piappino mushroom also known also known as agrocibe agirita and it's a wonderful wonderful mushroom that has this really nice edible stem and nice velvet amber kind of cap these are still in their young stage so we'll let them grow out a couple more days and we'll get a nice height off of them and the caps will kind of go from this dark color to a nice light orange color the mushroom has an actual kind of somewhat of a mild pork-like flavor when sauteed and it's really good in like pastas and and kind of like Mediterranean saladishes really anything that calls for mushrooms as well so this is one of my favorites to grow and I like that it produces tons of these mushrooms and they grow very quick from the time that I inoculate to going in the grow room it's usually about three weeks so very quick grower it's a hard wood loving mushroom and it has some medicinal benefits as well it's you know immuno enhancing it's anti-cancer anti-tumor and it's also been used or it's been shown to help with like fever reduction and stuff like that so it's also just a good mushroom to have in your diet that covers it for these gourmet and exotic mushrooms to go over the names again we had the pink oyster plurotus desomorph the golden oyster or yellow oyster plurotus citrona pleides the lion's mane perician aranacias and we have the namaiko mushroom the folio de namaiko the piappino mushroom agro-sai bagerita and then we have the blue oyster the plurotus

growing in this area we'll put turkey tail in here my talky anything that's gonna take quite a while like you know six to eight weeks or more kind of comes this area at this point to we do have some anoki over here plenty of shataki at different stages of colonization and then yeah more racie of course some of the racie we've left for quite a while it's been here since March so it's going on five months and some of them are starting to grow conks right out the filter patches and I think it's pretty cool so I've just been letting letting some of them do their thing usually I'll cut the cut the back down and put it into the growing environment to get really nice racie formations but we had a over abundance of racie this like in the last couple months so some of them just been hanging out here and then we notice they're just that could be a full conk starting to form really not much humidity in this warehouse too so it just shows how resilient this strain is so it's grown perfectly and yeah it's pretty dry in here so that's pretty cool it's definitely probably able to uptake a lot more water from the fruiting bodies inside the inside the growing bag so yeah then yeah we just have some shatakis these were inoculated about a month ago so they've already gone through the popcorn stage and then they're going to begin browning as we have some of them back there that are pretty ripe and we have some freshly inoculated inoki bags that are just about two or three days into colonization and more racie so this is racie that was inoculated a month ago and we're just starting to get the beginning stages of the fruit body formation that you can see so these will just be left to grow until the racie mushrooms make their way towards the top of the bag at that point I can cut the bag down put them in the grow room and let them finish off in the grow room and they really really take a nice form and then we have another cool racie right here this is called the tiger racie my first time growing it but it looks beautiful see what it looks like towards the end of its development and here we have a bunch of golden and okie these ones were left to just fruit inside the bag given them more of the heightened CO2 environment they grow these really elongated stems and really small caps and this is usually how you'll find them in market so it's another cool way to grow them it's a cold preference strain so we're growing it in the middle of summer here and it does find in the grow room when we cut the bag down it gets a bigger cap because it's exposed to a higher oxygen level but yeah when you're on like this you get more of the elongated stems this is kind of an experiment as well so yeah we have a bunch of them and I do one of them you can see really nice golden and okie coming along and actually I always see the golden and okie start to form mushrooms inside the bag and getting them into the grow room is usually what I do when I start to see a good pin set but I traded a culture with a friend a fungi John or John Martin and he showed me that they they had actually harvested some just out of the bag like this so it's a good way to get some nice and okie mushrooms with some nicely elongated stems and great for the perfect application in certain Asian dishes and stuff like that so and then yeah we have these blocks that were just inoculated within the last 48 hours or so and we can see each spot where the grain spawn has basically taken off and formed new mycelium and is reaching out to start the colonization process with the sawdust blend that we have sterilized for it so yeah we can see that the spawn is evenly mixed and you can each spot will basically grow take over the substrate until everything meets up forming this really nice infused network of mycelium that you can put into the proper conditions and get some wonderful mushrooms off of all right just making my way through the incubation and this is a towards the end we have the folio does over here just the chestnut and the makeo so chestnut would be the folio to add a posa and the makeo of course is folio to the makeo and these ones generally take about six weeks and the makeo usually about eight weeks before I want to get in the grow room so here we are exactly eight weeks after inoculation this was inoculated on the 16th of June and today is the 16th of August and the makeo have just started pinning so we would see these baby mushrooms so the beginnings of fruit body formation and they just start off with these red little spots or oranges little spots that you see some of them have a little stem and a small cap so it's known as like a pin so these blocks have started pinning and they have these little pinhead like mushrooms certain a grow on the blocks so I just see these beautiful little mushrooms the makeo is one of my favorites I just love the way it looks and love the way it tastes as well a nice earthy flavor but I like to go this mushroom as it gets towards the fall time cooler weather so it's basically that and we have a bunch of shatake still going here we like to keep a lot of them in incubation and we have one of them or we have a bunch of them actually but I have one of them right here to show you kind of what it looks like when the block begins to ripen this is two days before the two month anniversary of the inoculation of this block and we can see the nice browning that we have going we could let it go for another month and it would be really brown but at this point it's safe to fruit the mushroom block you'd get a great yield off of it and really good quality mushrooms so shatake is one that requires patience and whatnot but it's well worth the weight in my opinion it's a great mushroom so we have some mushrooms dehydrating over here this is a lion's mane and we harvested this fresh and basically loaded up into the dehydrator to make it available for all those that want to use the medicinal properties of lion's mane to their benefit so we'll use this dehydrated and just dry mushrooms that we prefer drying like some rachy mushrooms or lion's mane or even some of the mushrooms that go into our medleys or dried mixes just to preserve the mushrooms and I know a lot of people sometimes prefer having dried mushrooms available over fresh just because of the usability of them we can also use these for mushroom powders and stuff like that so the mushrooms will be loaded up and we can kind of set the temperature and the time depending on what mushroom we have in dehydration we can do the preferred temperature so these are going at 140 currently and we'll let these go basically for a whole day usually about 20 hours and at that point they're nice and bone dry and perfectly ready to go for the

E.  zero so this is the strain that produces more of the teeth and it's actually fruited right off the side for the first flush so we can just have a nice diversity of the way the fruit bodies develop so we can just kind of have a lot of different options for any way that wants the mushroom right here we just loaded up some chestnut mushrooms some of them have like started top fruiting before we could get them in the girl room so at that point I just cut the top of the bag off and put it in the girl room the mushrooms will get pretty big chestnuts and when you don't see that many mushrooms I find that usually the mushrooms get really meaty and a lot of the mushrooms or a lot of the blocks are just side fruited or top fruited so we just load the blocks in just like we do any of these ones and just make a nice diagonal cut on the front of the block so we can get a nice crop then we just have some lions man really old this is like a fourth flush some of them we've just been letting hang around especially this time of year where it's a little bit slower for us in the day of the summer so we have a lot more space to grow more mushrooms so just let them do their thing but this actually started out as one of the you know 10 to 12 pound blocks so you can see how much mass the mushroom has utilized is basically just broken down the substrate and exalted it into these fresh mushroom fruit bodies so that's pretty amazing and the block weighs next to nothing I would say it's like a it's about a five pound block right now so it's seven pounds of seven pounds gone into mushrooms so it's pretty cool and that's actually basically it for this girl I mean sides that and it's fully stocked and we'll be harvesting out of this girl for quite a while should get quite a yield",

anti-cancer anti-tumor benefits those amino modulating immune system enhancing benefits so these are the mushrooms that I like to eat and I hope you do too this is called Ganna Derma Cecil this is a

benefits we can take it and brew it into a tea or make tinctures out of it and utilize it for the health properties or health enhancing benefits that this mushroom offers it's been used by Eastern medicine for about 4,000 years so it's definitely good for a lot of things and it's known as the mushroom of immortality so we'll just cut these mushrooms off they're really woody compared to most mushrooms most mushrooms are 90% water and 10% tissue this mushroom here is about 70% water and 30% tissue so it makes a real woody woody mushroom that needs to be can't be resalted or cooked it really needs to be boiled down into a tea to get all those goodies out of it so I'm just trimming here the base right now just getting all these we had a lot of demand for racie I wasn't growing that much of it at first and then I kind of was just doing it for personal and then I kind of brought some out to the farmer's market and just kind of started sharing with it with people and from there I got a huge demand everybody asking for it and recently with a lot of things that are going on everybody really wants to root racie mushrooms just because of the immune modulating benefits and the health enhancing properties that this mushroom offers so yeah depending on demand or if a mushroom's not selling too good if we don't see it doing too good we'll just trim back on demand and just grow what we need I'm starting to see more specialty mushrooms available as they're gaining popularity a lot of people are catching on to a lot of the knowledge that comes with the specialty mushrooms and health benefits so we're supplying a couple grocery stores out here in Phoenix AJ's fine foods is one of them and two other grocery stores in the East Valley called the Super Sition Ranch Farm Market and people love them people are excited to be able to try something new and not your typical average run of the you know run of the mill but in our Portobello mushroom something that has more flavor and you can kind of get creative with some of these mushrooms and really do something unique this racie was inaugulated in on December 14th so it's four months old it took about four months to get here from the day of inoculation to now it takes quite a while this one does take longer than any of the mushrooms that we grow and there we go we have a beautiful set of racie mushrooms that is just amazing yeah racie typically it goes for for about four months a hundred and day hundred and twenty or so this one we harvest shatake about two months eight weeks oyster I can do those in three weeks sometimes less if it's the pink oyster usually you'll see fruits in as little as ten days from the day of inoculation so you can kind of play with what strain works best for your time and your schedule the price is kind of developed by us due to the cost of production like the labor involved for harvesting does it take longer is it easy is there much cleaning needed for each mushroom and you know really how long does it take to grow for us how long do we have to wait before we can harvest and get the mushroom the product so yeah oysters are going to kind of be the most affordable from us just because we can grow them so quick and racie is going to be the most expensive because it takes so long also another thing that comes into play is the demand and the demand high or low for this mushroom so like lion's mane has quite a bit of demand medicinally and and culinary so we have a little bit of a higher price point on that one and typically you'll see mushrooms averaging anywhere from eight bucks a pound to eighteen bucks a pound depending on if it's wholesale or retail and then racie I mean it could be up to fifteen dollars an ounce dry or or even lower than that depending on who grew it if it came from China you can get Chinese grown racie for like forty bucks a pound thirty bucks a pound dry all right well here's our lion's mane this mushroom also called Hiroshima and Asius is a wonderful teeth fungi so instead of having a traditional cap and gills this mushroom has these little spines that elongate and give it a really unique look appearance texture and also just qualities the mushroom is a medicinal mushroom as well as the culinary delight known for the fact that it can enhance cognitive function boost your memory help regenerate old dead brain cells so it promotes nerve growth factor it helps synthesize new basically NGF through herisonones and hearing asians so we'll just harvest the mushroom kind of just pull it right up I do something a little different so for the first flush I like to top-fruit this mushroom I'll grow it right out the front and it just produces this lovely mass of lion's mane mushrooms once that's harvested the baggie will get rolled up and fold it over and then I'll just put a couple of slices on the bag to help for a second flush to pop out and that second flush will basically be just this nice cluster of lions mane so I'm getting the most out of this mushroom and the nature you this would be a hardwood loving species that you would just find growing right off the side of a hardwood tree and yeah a lot of people will use it for the for like a crab or lobster replacement they say that the teeth give it to texture similar to crab or lobster I personally don't eat seafood but I do love this mushroom and it has a wonderful flavor I can add it into like do a mushroom taco with it or add it into a stir fry with another mushroom and just get this wonderful texture from it once the CO2 levels are are real low and the moisture levels are really high the mushrooms are signal to to produce high CO2 is something that the mushrooms encountered during colonization phases and then high O2 levels are when the mushroom mycelium is really starting to break through that surface of the tree and be exposed to to conditions basically optimum for mushroom fruit body production and then for the cleaning of the lions man we just have this little little bit of sawdust right on the back and you can just kind of tear that right off or trim it with scissors and then yeah we have just a clean nice lion's mane that's ready for the market or medicine",
        "context": "So yeah we give our blocks a really nice smack on all sides and from there we throw them in our grow room and that gives us this really nice pin set where we just get mushrooms all over the block and we're really happy with that so yeah and then when it comes time to harvest we just basically cut each mushroom right off into our tray and then from there we can go ahead and pack everything in the next warehouse and get everything to the desired weights in our cases and get it into the cold storage.  Shataki's have quite a good shelf life once harvested the mushrooms generally last two to three weeks oyster mushrooms have the shortest shelf life usually we're seeing those in about seven days they're really no longer marketable we can take those home and eat them ourselves or possibly dry them and turn it into another product.

now it takes quite a while this one does take longer than any of the mushrooms that we grow and there we go we have a beautiful set of racie mushrooms that is just amazing yeah racie typically it goes for for about four months a hundred and day hundred and twenty or so this one we harvest shatake about two months eight weeks oyster I can do those in three weeks sometimes less if it's the pink oyster usually you'll see fruits in as little as ten days from the day of inoculation so you can kind of play with what strain works best for your time and your schedule the price is kind of developed by us due to the cost of production like the labor involved for harvesting does it take longer is it easy is there much cleaning needed for each mushroom and you know really how long does it take to grow for us how long do we have to wait before we can harvest and get the mushroom the product so yeah oysters are going to kind of be the most affordable from us just because we can grow them so quick and racie is going to be the most expensive because it takes so long also another thing that comes into play is the demand and the demand high or low for this mushroom so like lion's mane has quite a bit of demand medicinally and and culinary so we have a little bit of a higher price point on that one and typically you'll see mushrooms averaging anywhere from eight bucks a pound to eighteen bucks a pound depending on if it's wholesale or retail and then racie I mean it could be up to fifteen dollars an ounce dry or or even lower than that depending on who grew it if it came from China you can get Chinese grown racie for like forty bucks a pound thirty bucks a pound dry all right well here's our lion's mane this mushroom also called Hiroshima and Asius is a wonderful teeth fungi so instead of having a traditional cap and gills this mushroom has these little spines that elongate and give it a really unique look appearance texture and also just qualities the mushroom is a medicinal mushroom as well as the culinary delight known for the fact that it can enhance cognitive function boost your memory help regenerate old dead brain cells so it promotes nerve growth factor it helps synthesize new basically NGF through herisonones and hearing asians so we'll just harvest the mushroom kind of just pull it right up I do something a little different so for the first flush I like to top-fruit this mushroom I'll grow it right out the front and it just produces this lovely mass of lion's mane mushrooms once that's harvested the baggie will get rolled up and fold it over and then I'll just put a couple of slices on the bag to help for a second flush to pop out and that second flush will basically be just this nice cluster of lions mane so I'm getting the most out of this mushroom and the nature you this would be a hardwood loving species that you would just find growing right off the side of a hardwood tree and yeah a lot of people will use it for the for like a crab or lobster replacement they say that the teeth give it to texture similar to crab or lobster I personally don't eat seafood but I do love this mushroom and it has a wonderful flavor I can add it into like do a mushroom taco with it or add it into a stir fry with another mushroom and just get this wonderful texture from it once the CO2 levels are are real low and the moisture levels are really high the mushrooms are signal to to produce high CO2 is something that the mushrooms encountered during colonization phases and then high O2 levels are when the mushroom mycelium is really starting to break through that surface of the tree and be exposed to to conditions basically optimum for mushroom fruit body production and then for the cleaning of the lions man we just have this little little bit of sawdust right on the back and you can just kind of tear that right off or trim it with scissors and then yeah we have just a clean nice lion's mane that's ready for the market or medicine",

        "step": "Alright, so we're just in the secondary incubation area over here in warehouse number two and this is where all the longer colonizing species come such as Shataki we have a racie growing in this area we'll put turkey tail in here my talky anything that's gonna take quite a while like you know six to eight weeks or more kind of comes this area at this point to we do have some anoki over here plenty of shataki at different stages of colonization and then yeah more racie of course some of the racie we've left for quite a while it's been here since March so it's going on five months and some of them are starting to grow conks right out the filter patches and I think it's pretty cool so I've just been letting letting some of them do their thing usually I'll cut the cut the back down and put it into the growing environment to get really nice racie formations but we had a over abundance of racie this like in the last couple months so some of them just been hanging out here and then we notice they're just that could be a full conk starting to form really not much humidity in this warehouse too so it just shows how resilient this strain is so it's grown perfectly and yeah it's pretty dry in here so that's pretty cool it's definitely probably able to uptake a lot more water from the fruiting bodies inside the inside the growing bag so yeah then yeah we just have some shatakis these were inoculated about a month ago so they've already gone through the popcorn stage and then they're going to begin browning as we have some of them back there that are pretty ripe and we have some freshly inoculated inoki bags that are just about two or three days into colonization and more racie so this is racie that was inoculated a month ago and we're just starting to get the beginning stages of the fruit body formation that you can see so these will just be left to grow until the racie mushrooms make their way towards the top of the bag at that point I can cut the bag down put them in the grow room and let them finish off in the grow room and they really really take a nice form and then we have another cool racie right here this is called the tiger racie my first time growing it but it looks beautiful see what it looks like towards the end of its development and here we have a bunch of golden and okie these ones were left to just fruit inside the bag given them more of the heightened CO2 environment they grow these really elongated stems and really small caps and this is usually how you'll find them in market so it's another cool way to grow them it's a cold preference strain so we're growing it in the middle of summer here and it does find in the grow room when we cut the bag down it gets a bigger cap because it's exposed to a higher oxygen level but yeah when you're on like this you get more of the elongated stems this is kind of an experiment as well so yeah we have a bunch of them and I do one of them you can see really nice golden and okie coming along and actually I always see the golden and okie start to form mushrooms inside the bag and getting them into the grow room is usually what I do when I start to see a good pin set but I traded a culture with a friend a fungi John or John Martin and he showed me that they they had actually harvested some just out of the bag like this so it's a good way to get some nice and okie mushrooms with some nicely elongated stems and great for the perfect application in certain Asian dishes and stuff like that so and then yeah we have these blocks that were just inoculated within the last 48 hours or so and we can see each spot where the grain spawn has basically taken off and formed new mycelium and is reaching out to start the colonization process with the sawdust blend that we have sterilized for it so yeah we can see that the spawn is evenly mixed and you can each spot will basically grow take over the substrate until everything meets up forming this really nice infused network of mycelium that you can put into the proper conditions and get some wonderful mushrooms off of all right just making my way through the incubation and this is a towards the end we have the folio does over here just the chestnut and the makeo so chestnut would be the folio to add a posa and the makeo of course is folio to the makeo and these ones generally take about six weeks and the makeo usually about eight weeks before I want to get in the grow room so here we are exactly eight weeks after inoculation this was inoculated on the 16th of June and today is the 16th of August and the makeo have just started pinning so we would see these baby mushrooms so the beginnings of fruit body formation and they just start off with these red little spots or oranges little spots that you see some of them have a little stem and a small cap so it's known as like a pin so these blocks have started pinning and they have these little pinhead like mushrooms certain a grow on the blocks so I just see these beautiful little mushrooms the makeo is one of my favorites I just love the way it looks and love the way it tastes as well a nice earthy flavor but I like to go this mushroom as it gets towards the fall time cooler weather so it's basically that and we have a bunch of shatake still going here we like to keep a lot of them in incubation and we have one of them or we have a bunch of them actually but I have one of them right here to show you kind of what it looks like when the block begins to ripen this is two days before the two month anniversary of the inoculation of this block and we can see the nice browning that we have going we could let it go for another month and it would be really brown but at this point it's safe to fruit the mushroom block you'd get a great yield off of it and really good quality mushrooms so shatake is one that requires patience and whatnot but it's well worth the weight in my opinion it's a great mushroom so we have some mushrooms dehydrating over here this is a lion's mane and we harvested this fresh and basically loaded up into the dehydrator to make it available for all those that want to use the medicinal properties of lion's mane to their benefit so we'll use this dehydrated and just dry mushrooms that we prefer drying like some rachy mushrooms or lion's mane or even some of the mushrooms that go into our medleys or dried mixes just to preserve the mushrooms and I know a lot of people sometimes prefer having dried mushrooms available over fresh just because of the usability of them we can also use these for mushroom powders and stuff like that so the mushrooms will be loaded up and we can kind of set the temperature and the time depending on what mushroom we have in dehydration we can do the preferred temperature so these are going at 140 currently and we'll let these go basically for a whole day usually about 20 hours and at that point they're nice and bone dry and perfectly ready to go for the next applications so",

Each little seed becomes a vehicle to carry the mycelium into our substrate and basically acts as an inoculation point from which mycelium can start to grow and reach for new food sources such as our oaks audis.

        "context": "So I got these liquid culture syringes that I use so they're just longer needles they're like three and a quarter inches so perfect for sucking up liquid out of a jar.  I'll just get some of these fully colonized cultures so you can see the mycelium is pretty it's taken over liquid quite a bit you can see a nice nice mass of mycelium in there so go ahead and start agitating the mycelium making it easier to take up into our syringes.  Just have a bunch of these syringes kind of just get everything's a nice spray down with some of the isopropyl alcohol also spray down my liquid culture lids all the cultures have been colonizing within the positive pressured laboratory 100% of the time so they've ever left the lab after inoculation and the syringe caps these have been auto-claved they're pressure-cooked so they're completely sterile I use these to cap up the syringe at the end of the process.  It's a backtie scinerator so it's just a tool that you can utilize to sterilize scalples syringes and also like inoculation loops so generally it'll heat up to like around 1800 degrees so it's pretty hot in there and when you use it to sterilize something you only need a few seconds I actually just turned it on so it does have a little warm up time it takes like a few minutes to get to the temperature that you want it but if you don't have one of these you could just use a lighter torch that's what I used for a long time and so I just ended up giving it because I wanted one so but it's nice it helps save me time six times in the lab set a half an hour like reach and light up the torch or you know keep anything lit this thing stays on the whole time and I can just use it as needed so you have the syringe in the jar let us twirl it around and then bring the liquid culture up in there just cap the syringe like that just kind of continue the process until all of the inoculant has been uptaken into syringes so we can see a nice liquid culture full of what mycelium so this will just get inoculated into like a green spawn bag or jar and used to grow out your spawn each of these jars will make 40 syringes each of these syringes are about 12 CCs so a little bit over 40 syringes I have 500 milliliters of inoculant in here and each jar turns out quite a bit with each of these syringes you can inoculate hundreds of more jars of liquid culture or each syringe can inoculate 12 pounds of grain spawn you can expand it several different kinds of ways you can use the liquid culture to drop a drop a drop on a peachy dish to grow out the culture that way and then from there you can make much more liquid culture to make more grain spawn and really just stretch it as far as you can also these liquid cultures are really good for anybody that is just using still air box or inoculating without a lab they can flamethrower sterilize the needle and just go directly into the grain spawn at that point so if I intake the liquid culture into the syringe and I noticed that there's too much air in it then I'll just shoot it back into the jar and re-take the inoculant just because we want the syringe to be full we just want the smallest air bubble in the syringe that way right before you proceed to inoculation you can shake the syringe and in that way the mycelium is able to break up and be evenly distributed and suspended throughout the liquid culture and that gives it you know more dispersion and even distribution when you're going ahead in inoculating a grain spawn or whatever you're doing so I like to have that little little bubble of sterile air just in the syringe but if it's like a whole CC up air then I'll definitely shoot it back into the jar and just re-take the liquid at that point so yeah so yeah that's it for one jar of a master liquid culture I can wash the jar out wash the lid and just reuse the components but that's it I'll just go through and do this for every jar I think I have about 20 of them to do today 22 so yeah about 800 syringes so it's a really really cool process yeah very nice and a good way to keep the mushroom mycelium in the library and yeah just a great piece of growing inocular it's good to have so yeah we'll go ahead and inoculate one of the sterile green bags with liquid culture for the blue green oyster so I'll get myself ready to do a quick little inoculation just grab a little paper towel and you can do this in front of a flow hood or without a flow hood in front of an in-it still air box or just make sure if you don't if you don't have a still air box you can just do it in a home without the with the air conditioning off so I'll just wipe the injection port real good and I will douse the syringe tip into a little bit of isopropyl go ahead and bring that out remove the cap from the syringe go ahead and put the cap on so now I have a nice syringe you can go ahead and just do a nice little simple shake like that by beating it on the surface or edge of a table that really breaks up to my cylinder nice and usually I would usually use a lighter or a torch just to torch the end of the syringe until it's going red hot but I'll use the back ties appert just to be sure as I stick the needle through the injection port if there's any potential contamination that goes onto the needle

minutes to get to the temperature that you want it but if you don't have one of these you could just use a lighter torch that's what I used for a long time and so I just ended up giving it because I wanted one so but it's nice it helps save me time six times in the lab set a half an hour like reach and light up the torch or you know keep anything lit this thing stays on the whole time and I can just use it as needed so you have the syringe in the jar let us twirl it around and then bring the liquid culture up in there just cap the syringe like that just kind of continue the process until all of the inoculant has been uptaken into syringes so we can see a nice liquid culture full of what mycelium so this will just get inoculated into like a green spawn bag or jar and used to grow out your

with each of these syringes you can inoculate hundreds of more jars of liquid culture or each syringe can inoculate 12 pounds of grain spawn you can expand it several different kinds of ways you can use the liquid culture to drop a drop a drop on a peachy dish to grow out the culture that way and then from there you can make much more liquid culture to make more grain spawn and really just stretch it as far as you can also these liquid cultures are really good for anybody that is just using still air box or inoculating without a lab they can flamethrower sterilize the needle and just go directly into the grain spawn at that point so if I intake the liquid culture into the syringe and I noticed that there's too much air in it then I'll just shoot it back into the jar and re-take the inoculant just because we want the syringe to be full we just want the smallest air bubble in the syringe that way right before you proceed to inoculation you can shake the syringe and in that way the

inoculating a grain spawn or whatever you're doing so I like to have that little little bubble of sterile air just in the syringe but if it's like a whole CC up air then I'll definitely shoot it back

Mike is inoculating these bags with this inoculated grain and as all we're doing is breaking up the grain you get big clumps in there so we're just breaking up that grain on the top here and then we'll go ahead and break up all the substrate and we're basically just trying to evenly distribute all this grain into this block and then about two weeks you'll have a fully colonized substrate block ready to go into the grow room and grow some mushrooms",

really need a maximize our space that's why I like growing on hardwood sawdust because you can just make blocks and you can build with them and stack them and make walls walls of mushrooms so much better for me and for people that are growing in small spaces and you don't have access to tons of space to grow sawdust works great all those oysters are done and like I said the oysters are really easy to load compared to shataki where it takes more work I also have this pink oyster we'll go ahead and put that in Gerberum one today that's it that's it everything for today as far as loading into the Gerberum we'll periodically step into the incubation center every day and take a look to see what's going to be going in next and try to plan accordingly so you'll also notice that each mushroom mycelium gives off a smell that's really really fragrant and each species has their own unique characteristic type smell so we'll find like the oyster mushrooms are kind of like a somewhat reminiscent of like an inesite or like a like a vanilla extract and like shataki smells like crushed fresh shataki mushrooms lion's mane has like a nice pleasant smell and it smells like fresh lion's mane mushrooms so you'll build the smell your spawn or your fruiting blocks and you can kind of tell how help they are as you can see they are they're just really ready to go into the Gerberum we notice there's some nice little clusters of baby oyster mushrooms popping up all over the place these literally just popped up within the last day so we're gonna get them in there and within a week these will be ready for harvest and it's for eating all right start placing them in here we're just doing some stacking in here to make room for a few extra blocks that way I can get everything on one rack which is gonna make a simple cut on each bag so we'll start from the top row and just come straight through and I'll also make a line right here and right there and that for me has given the given the best opportunity for the mushrooms to grow and develop without them getting caught under anything plastic so I get really good yields by making my cuts like this it also doesn't make it to where your block is too exposed like if you were to cut an X it can kind of open up a little bit more than this very easy initiation process with the oyster mushroom so it's crazy how these oyster mushrooms or any of the mushrooms can can produce so much uh so much food in such a little space here just from this one rack alone we have so we have we have almost 40 blocks we'll get about three pounds of block this will be 120 pounds just coming from one rack so not much space required to grow lots of lots of mushrooms it's one of the things very unique about them you just take these small spaces and maximize them and that's it I'll just double check to make sure I don't miss anything and looks good so at this point I will seal up my grow room so I can let this humidity stay in there and let these mushrooms start to get what they need as far as environmental conditions and stuff like that and we'll also take a step into the pink list of room or grow room one try to get this pink oyster block in there so we can get these mushrooms off of it so just cut a little hole at the top and uh first of all the air out what you could do too let's just take it open up your bag and you can see all these pink oysters that we have growing in there we can just go ahead and take those out and remove them the way it's easy to put our block on the rack and it's not fun even this could be cooked up and used as food or it's usually really tough and not really desirable but you could also dry it and powder it use that for like a soup or something like that now we'll just go ahead and fold up the block as usual and uh I just go ahead and put it right on top of one of these blocks just like that I'm just going and slice that up let that grow and as you see this grow room is uh looking pretty good we have some pink oysters in here growing out and uh different just a couple different varieties of trumpet like the black pearl king trumpet growing on alder sawdust and it's about it I'm going to get some stuff harvested in here and so these will be ready in about 24 hours these have been going in here for about four days I put these in here actually they've been going for about five days now I loaded these up on Saturday so now we're on we're on Thursday and they are quite well developed some of them more than others so we'll look look back here let's say this one for instance and we can see the mushrooms are developed pretty well well at these grow at another day because they're definitely going to increase in size the pink oyster compared to like the blue and white oysters is you don't get as much biological efficiency meaning the yield isn't quite as much so usually we average about two pounds on these but they're just beautiful mushrooms for their color and they do taste pretty good and really it's the color that dazzles people but it's just like in another oyster mushroom as far as flavor goes and you can utilize them in recipes that call for mushrooms but they grow very easily so that's what a plus and they love the warm temperatures so if you live in a warmer part of the world then pink oysters are our mushroom for you they have some third flush pappinos back here so these have been these were actually in our last or one of our growing videos but we flushed them a couple times already some of these are a little bit well those were overdone so yeah these were actually ready yesterday but I didn't get to them in time so they're a little bit over mature and that means that they're basically just a little over ripe so the caps are starting to curl up and they're a little bit wavy and we also noticed that there's a nice sport deposits so they're starting to produce a lot of spores so this is a good stage to go ahead and take a spore print if anything I mean we can see all the spores that are coming out and really you just really want to grow these mushrooms like this if you're just going to eat them for personal use or if you just know some way that really like some like this but they don't last as long in the fridge so this is kind of what I like to this is why I like to harvest them when the caps are still kind of rolled in like this so that's peak peak harvest time or right as the veal has just started to break so you can see this right here this is called the veal of the mushroom and that's usually attached all the way up until maturity so that's another way to determine the age of the mushroom we could see these pappino mushrooms where the veal has just started to break off and we can go ahead and harvest these now and they'll maintain a really nice flavor for quite a long time and the store a lot longer in the fridge compared to you know some of our over harvested pappinis but these still taste excellent so we'll just take these home and cook them in our own dinner tonight they go great in like pasta sauces and soups and really whatever it's a great mushroom it has like a nice blue oyster this was like a third flush for us so we're still getting good yields I mean I would say this is almost half a pound so for a third flush that's pretty good fine ok",
        "context": "I always fold my bag with the filter patch facing in there's been times where I when I first started and I accidentally folded a bag like that I found that the mycelium was actually able to creep up and grow throughout this filter patch and I found mushrooms growing throughout the filter patch as well.  Same with lions man a lot of these strains if you're do if you are like side fruiting make sure you're folding this filter patch inwards that way the mycelium the oxygen and stuff like that is blocked off if the mycelium grows up here it's not going to produce any fruit bodies so that won't deduct from any of your yields and your mycelium won't be utilizing any or exhaust any unnecessary energy producing those fruit bodies that really are no good and have no market value.

So it's still uh About you know 35 years since the shitake were really brought out in a commercial In a commercial way But they've been grown in like Japan and China for for quite a long time on the USDA agriculture uh, Sheets the price sheet Shitake are a little bit more expensive than oysters that they average about like 450 Uphound on like a commercial wholesale price average Which is super cheap for the grower that's just growing them for there's local local market Where they average in a local setting.

I don't know Um, or from a just bigger distributor that grows them at a wider wider level than me But most of the time they want something more exotic like the lion's mane the chestnuts the piappini Some colored oyster mushroom variety whether it be pink or blue gold But the shitake do excellent at a farmers market and if you can get in with a grocery store They do great there um, it's a common mushroom All you know for gourmet mushrooms.  It's like our gourmet portobella or button because everybody knows about shitake This is my second grow room and this is most this is my shitake and my racie mushroom grow room it I grow in this grow room for shitake because it does have a lower speed fan setting for the exhaust All the other rooms are more high-powered The grow room 3 has its own exclusive air system So that one I can really utilize to just power out some oyster mushrooms And I do lion's mane very well in there",

growing in this area we'll put turkey tail in here my talky anything that's gonna take quite a while like you know six to eight weeks or more kind of comes this area at this point to we do have some anoki over here plenty of shataki at different stages of colonization and then yeah more racie of course some of the racie we've left for quite a while it's been here since March so it's going on five months and some of them are starting to grow conks right out the filter patches and I think it's pretty cool so I've just been letting letting some of them do their thing usually I'll cut the cut the back down and put it into the growing environment to get really nice racie formations but we had a over abundance of racie this like in the last couple months so some of them just been hanging out here and then we notice they're just that could be a full conk starting to form really not much humidity in this warehouse too so it just shows how resilient this strain is so it's grown perfectly and yeah it's pretty dry in here so that's pretty cool it's definitely probably able to uptake a lot more water from the fruiting bodies inside the inside the growing bag so yeah then yeah we just have some shatakis these were inoculated about a month ago so they've already gone through the popcorn stage and then they're going to begin browning as we have some of them back there that are pretty ripe and we have some freshly inoculated inoki bags that are just about two or three days into colonization and more racie so this is racie that was inoculated a month ago and we're just starting to get the beginning stages of the fruit body formation that you can see so these will just be left to grow until the racie mushrooms make their way towards the top of the bag at that point I can cut the bag down put them in the grow room and let them finish off in the grow room and they really really take a nice form and then we have another cool racie right here this is called the tiger racie my first time growing it but it looks beautiful see what it looks like towards the end of its development and here we have a bunch of golden and okie these ones were left to just fruit inside the bag given them more of the heightened CO2 environment they grow these really elongated stems and really small caps and this is usually how you'll find them in market so it's another cool way to grow them it's a cold preference strain so we're growing it in the middle of summer here and it does find in the grow room when we cut the bag down it gets a bigger cap because it's exposed to a higher oxygen level but yeah when you're on like this you get more of the elongated stems this is kind of an experiment as well so yeah we have a bunch of them and I do one of them you can see really nice golden and okie coming along and actually I always see the golden and okie start to form mushrooms inside the bag and getting them into the grow room is usually what I do when I start to see a good pin set but I traded a culture with a friend a fungi John or John Martin and he showed me that they they had actually harvested some just out of the bag like this so it's a good way to get some nice and okie mushrooms with some nicely elongated stems and great for the perfect application in certain Asian dishes and stuff like that so and then yeah we have these blocks that were just inoculated within the last 48 hours or so and we can see each spot where the grain spawn has basically taken off and formed new mycelium and is reaching out to start the colonization process with the sawdust blend that we have sterilized for it so yeah we can see that the spawn is evenly mixed and you can each spot will basically grow take over the substrate until everything meets up forming this really nice infused network of mycelium that you can put into the proper conditions and get some wonderful mushrooms off of all right just making my way through the incubation and this is a towards the end we have the folio does over here just the chestnut and the makeo so chestnut would be the folio to add a posa and the makeo of course is folio to the makeo and these ones generally take about six weeks and the makeo usually about eight weeks before I want to get in the grow room so here we are exactly eight weeks after inoculation this was inoculated on the 16th of June and today is the 16th of August and the makeo have just started pinning so we would see these baby mushrooms so the beginnings of fruit body formation and they just start off with these red little spots or oranges little spots that you see some of them have a little stem and a small cap so it's known as like a pin so these blocks have started pinning and they have these little pinhead like mushrooms certain a grow on the blocks so I just see these beautiful little mushrooms the makeo is one of my favorites I just love the way it looks and love the way it tastes as well a nice earthy flavor but I like to go this mushroom as it gets towards the fall time cooler weather so it's basically that and we have a bunch of shatake still going here we like to keep a lot of them in incubation and we have one of them or we have a bunch of them actually but I have one of them right here to show you kind of what it looks like when the block begins to ripen this is two days before the two month anniversary of the inoculation of this block and we can see the nice browning that we have going we could let it go for another month and it would be really brown but at this point it's safe to fruit the mushroom block you'd get a great yield off of it and really good quality mushrooms so shatake is one that requires patience and whatnot but it's well worth the weight in my opinion it's a great mushroom so we have some mushrooms dehydrating over here this is a lion's mane and we harvested this fresh and basically loaded up into the dehydrator to make it available for all those that want to use the medicinal properties of lion's mane to their benefit so we'll use this dehydrated and just dry mushrooms that we prefer drying like some rachy mushrooms or lion's mane or even some of the mushrooms that go into our medleys or dried mixes just to preserve the mushrooms and I know a lot of people sometimes prefer having dried mushrooms available over fresh just because of the usability of them we can also use these for mushroom powders and stuff like that so the mushrooms will be loaded up and we can kind of set the temperature and the time depending on what mushroom we have in dehydration we can do the preferred temperature so these are going at 140 currently and we'll let these go basically for a whole day usually about 20 hours and at that point they're nice and bone dry and perfectly ready to go for the next applications so",

time growing it but it looks beautiful see what it looks like towards the end of its development and here we have a bunch of golden and okie these ones were left to just fruit inside the bag given them more of the heightened CO2 environment they grow these really elongated stems and really small caps and this is usually how you'll find them in market so it's another cool way to grow them it's a cold preference strain so we're growing it in the middle of summer here and it does find in the grow room when we cut the bag down it gets a bigger cap because it's exposed to a higher oxygen level but yeah when you're on like this you get more of the elongated stems this is kind of an experiment as well so yeah we have a bunch of them and I do one of them you can see really nice golden and okie coming along and actually I always see the golden and okie start to form mushrooms inside the bag and getting them into the grow room is usually what I do when I start to see a good pin set but I traded a culture with a friend a fungi John or John Martin and he showed me that they they had actually harvested some just out of the bag like this so it's a good way to get some nice and okie mushrooms with some nicely elongated stems and great for the perfect application in certain Asian dishes and stuff like that so and then yeah we have these blocks that were just inoculated within the last 48 hours or so and we can see each spot where the grain spawn has basically taken off and formed new mycelium and is reaching out to start the colonization process with the sawdust blend that we have sterilized for it so yeah we can see that the spawn is evenly mixed and you can each spot will basically grow take over the substrate until everything meets up forming this really nice infused network of mycelium that you can put into the proper conditions and get some wonderful mushrooms off of all right just making my way through the incubation and this is a towards the end we have the folio does over here just the chestnut and the makeo so chestnut would be the folio to add a posa and the makeo of course is folio to the makeo and these ones generally take about six weeks and the makeo usually about eight weeks before I want to get in the grow room so here we are exactly eight weeks after inoculation this was inoculated on the 16th of June and today is the 16th of August and the makeo have just started pinning so we would see these baby mushrooms so the beginnings of fruit body formation and they just start off with these red little spots or oranges little spots that you see some of them have a little stem and a small cap so it's known as like a pin so these blocks have started pinning and they have these little pinhead like mushrooms certain a grow on the blocks so I just see these beautiful little mushrooms the makeo is one of my favorites I just love the way it looks and love the way it tastes as well a nice earthy flavor but I like to go this mushroom as it gets towards the fall time cooler weather so it's basically that and we have a bunch of shatake still going here we like to keep a lot of them in incubation and we have one of them or we have a bunch of them actually but I have one of them right here to show you kind of what it looks like when the block begins to ripen this is two days before the two month anniversary of the inoculation of this block and we can see the nice browning that we have going we could let it go for another month and it would be really brown but at this point it's safe to fruit the mushroom block you'd get a great yield off of it and really good quality mushrooms so shatake is one that requires patience and whatnot but it's well worth the weight in my opinion it's a great mushroom so we have some mushrooms dehydrating over here this is a lion's mane and we harvested this fresh and basically loaded up into the dehydrator to make it available for all those that want to use the medicinal properties of lion's mane to their benefit so we'll use this dehydrated and just dry mushrooms that we prefer drying like some rachy mushrooms or lion's mane or even some of the mushrooms that go into our medleys or dried mixes just to preserve the mushrooms and I know a lot of people sometimes prefer having dried mushrooms available over fresh just because of the usability of them we can also use these for mushroom powders and stuff like that so the mushrooms will be loaded up and we can kind of set the temperature and the time depending on what mushroom we have in dehydration we can do the preferred temperature so these are going at 140 currently and we'll let these go basically for a whole day usually about 20 hours and at that point they're nice and bone dry and perfectly ready to go for the next applications so",

So each of those is labeled G2 that tells me when I'm going through my incubation area that oh this block has been inoculated with sawdust I can't really inoculate I can't use this to expand into more blocks this has to go into fruiting so I don't want to take it past the past the second generation of spawn.  I could very well take it past this and keep on going for another 10 blocks the only thing is my yields would dramatically start to decrease.
